This is my first dashboard after training on Tableau.
The First spread sheet on top left visualizes the average price increment based on the zip code.
Below, we can see the revenue generated by these hotels through the year 2016.
Next, below we see the variation in price in contrast to the number of bedrooms.
The large map layout on right gives a geographical representation of the first bar chart on the left for better understanding.
And lastly a small spreadsheet within the geographical map displays the number of listings based on number of bedrooms.
Please feel free to drop in some feedbacks/constructive criticism.
See you all on my next dashboard. Thank You.
